**This game was made in 48 hours for the "Yogcast Game Jam"!**

It's Christmas time and everybody is happy and joyful. But wait! Some people seem to be under a lot of stress. Of course, the Christmas time is a stressful time, not only for human beings. We have to get hold of Christmas presents, everything has to be snug and homely and then there are also these punches we always have to dodge..

Just try not to be beaten too badly and get as many glittering presents at home as you can. Because only when you get through this time of action and lack of time, you can really enjoy Christmas.

**We hope you like this little Christmas game and wish you a Merry Christmas!**
